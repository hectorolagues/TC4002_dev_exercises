# Python Coverage and Style Check â€“ Lab 6.1
Goal: The target of these exercises is to enable the student to practice and master programming skills during the course. In this case, the application of code coverage to measure the unit testing progress as well as the style check using known tools.

# Instructions
You are required to submit for all your previous exercises:
- Measure the coverage for your testing. Provide Screenshots for the measurements. Try to achieve at least 90% of Statement Coverage. 
- Get style checking tool and modify your programs at most 2 issues in PEP8 using module pycodestyle. Provide Screenshots as evidence.
- Upload your modified code into your GitRepo.
Modules to use:
- coverage and pycodestyle

# Deliverables
- Evidence of code coverage
- Achieving code coverage
- Evidence of at most 2 PEP8 style issues solved
- Link to the GitHub Repo
