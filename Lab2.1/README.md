# Python Development Exercises – L2.1
Goal: The target of these exercises is to enable the student to practice and master programming skills during the course.

# 4 - PYTHON FAILING
You need to create two functions to substitute str() and int(). A function called int_to_str() that converts integers into strings and a function called str_to_int() that converts strings into integers.
Examples:
int_to_str(4) ➞ "4"
str_to_int("4") ➞ 4
int_to_str(29348) ➞ "29348"
Provide 10 test cases for each function

# 5 - PROFIT
You work for a manufacturer, and have been asked to calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. You are given a dictionary containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), sell price per unit (in dollars), and the starting inventory. Return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.
Examples:
profit({
"cost_price": 32.67,
"sell_price": 45.00,
"inventory": 1200
}) ➞ 14796
profit({
"cost_price": 225.89,
"sell_price": 550.00,
"inventory": 100
}) ➞ 32411
profit({
"cost_price": 2.77,
"sell_price": 7.95,
"inventory": 8500
}) ➞ 44030
Notes:
Assume all inventory has been sold.
Profit = Total Sales - Total Cost
Provide 10 test cases
