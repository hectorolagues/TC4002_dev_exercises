# Logging and Debugging – Lab 8.1
Goal: This exercise provides the experience to implement different logging configurations for your application. As well as to try to debug issues in two software programs.

# Context
You are requested to use the Python logging module for such practice.

# Request
1. You have been asked to triage (find the issue of a program)
a. The program is included in the file BouncingBalls_bug.py
b. Failures
i.   The program is not behaving as it was specified, it should keep running with the bouncing ball for endless time until the user closes the application
ii.  The speed of the bouncing ball should be the same all the time
iii. When you click the space bar another ball should appear
c. The programs has three injected defects
d. Use any debugger looking to use features such as
i.   Exploring the value/state of variables/objects
ii.  Stop execution using breakpoints
iii. Any other tool feature that may help you
e. Upload your programs including two versions in your GIT repo – the one with the fixes and the one with the failures
2. You have been asked to triage (find the issue of a program)
a. The program is included in the file tictactioe_bug.py
b. Failures
i. The program is not behaving as it was specified
c. The programs has two injected defects
d. Use any debugger looking to use features such as
i.   Exploring the value/state of variables/objects
ii.  Stop execution using breakpoints
iii. Any other tool feature that may help you
e. Upload your programs including two versions in your GIT repo – the one with the fixes and the one with the failures
3. Add logs for one program that managed a directory (Lab 3.2)
a. Add logs for INFO messages
b. Add logs for ERROR messages
i.   Configure to send the log information to the console
c. Create this new lab as a new program in your repo
d. Save one run screenshot showing the logs and upload it to Canvas also
